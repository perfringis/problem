The genetic algorithm could be used for the reconstruction of the image by vector graphics. I think genetic algorithm is only useful for reconstruction part, but no for shuffling layers/images.

In the fitness function can be used Mean Squared Error(MSE) or Structural Similarity Index(SSIM) as an indicator of similarities or closeness of the image.

Selection, crossover, mutation and replacement are easy parts.

The Hill climbing algorithm is an optimization technique. Hill climbing will not necessarily find the global maximum, but may instead converge on a local maximum.

In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.

In statistics, the mean squared error (MSE)[1] or mean squared deviation (MSD) of an estimator (of a procedure for estimating an unobserved quantity) measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.

It's a method to determine if the image is close enough to the original.

The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index is a method for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index can be viewed as a quality measure of one of the images being compared, provided the other image is regarded as of perfect quality.

Create agent. Create rules of the game and give time for agent to play with 40 graphics and reward if image is close enough to original image.

## Ant Colony Optimization(optimization technique/solution)

> Link: https://web2.qatar.cmu.edu/~gdicaro/15382/additional/aco-book.pdf

ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used.[2] Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.
